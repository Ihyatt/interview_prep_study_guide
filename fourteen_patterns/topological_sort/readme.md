# Topological SOrt

Topological Sort is used to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other. For example, if event ‘B’ is dependent on event ‘A’, ‘A’ comes before ‘B’ in topological ordering.

How to identify the Topological Sort pattern:

> - The problem will deal with graphs that have no directed cycles
> - If you’re asked to update all objects in a sorted order
> - If you have a class of objects that follow a particular order
