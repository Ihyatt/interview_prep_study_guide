How do you identify when to use the Fast and Slow pattern?
* The problem will deal with a loop in a linked list or array
* When you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list.

When should I use it over the Two Pointer method mentioned above?
* There are some cases where you shouldn’t use the Two Pointer approach such as in a singly linked list where you can’t move in a backwards direction. An example of when to use the Fast and Slow pattern is when you’re trying to determine if a linked list is a palindrome.

Examples:

* Linked List Cycle
* Palindrome Linked List
* Cycle in a Circular Array
